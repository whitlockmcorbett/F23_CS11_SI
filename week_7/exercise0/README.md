# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a program that determines which quadrant a point lies in. If it falls on an axis or the origin, print that instead.

## Background information 
When doing any kind of graphing in two dimensions, it is very helpful to draw out an x- and y-axis. These two axes intersect at a point on the graph called the origin. In between these axes, there are four seperated areas called quadrants.

Write a program that takes in two integers and prints whether  it lies in the First, Second, Third, or Fourth Quadrant.

## Steps
1. Prompt user for x and y coordinates.
2. Determine and print which quadrant.

## Test Cases
```
Test 1
5 -6
Fourth Quadrant
```

```
Test 2
-1 6
Second Quadrant
```
```
Test 3
9 -9
Fourth Quadrant
```
```
Test 4
10 6
First Quadrant
```
```
Test 5
5 -8
Fourth Quadrant
```
```
Test 6
-4 -3
Third Quadrant
```

## Challenge
Modify your program so it prints out when the point lies on either an axis or on the origin.
