# Instructions
**Objective:** Determine the "playoff" points and total goals a team has

## Background information 
Imagine a sports league. In this sports league, to qualify for the playoffs you must earn a certain number of points during the season. A team is awarded 3 points for winning a game, 1 point for tieing a game, and 0 points for losing a game. 

Write a program which when given a score (A:B, where home team scored A and away team scored B), will calculate how many playoff points home/A team won. Afterwards, print out the total number of goals they scored during the season.

**Note**: all games will have scores in single digits

## Steps
1. From the console, read in an _arbitrary number_ of strings showing the scores. Ex: 4:6
2. Compute the number of playoff points Team A scored.
3. Compute the number of total goals Team A scored.
4. Output the previous two numbers
