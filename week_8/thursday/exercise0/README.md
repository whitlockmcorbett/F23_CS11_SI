# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a program to calculate how long ago a father was twice the age of his son.

## Background information 
Every person who is older than you was at one point twice your age. Take a moment to think why this is.

Your job is to implement a program that can compute how many years ago a father (of a given age) was twice as old as his son('s given age).

## Steps
1. From the console, read in two integers, representing the father and son's age.
2. Calculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as the son.
3. Print out the number of years.

## Test Cases
```
Test 1
88
49
10 years ago.
```
```
Test 2
47
26
5 years ago.
```
```
Test 3
70
37
4 years ago.
```
```
Test 4
49
28
7 years ago.
```
```
Test 5
90
50
10 years ago.
```

## Challenge
Modify your program so it works if the father is twice the age of his son or yet to be twice the age of his son.
