# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a program that reads in an entire line using `getline()`, then inpputs a number equal to a word in the entered line. Your program will output the word at that location.

## Background information 
We will define the first word in a sentence as word number `1`, then `2`, `3`, etc. Words will always be separated by spaces
For example in the sentence `Hello world this is a sentence`,  `Hello` is word `1`, `world` is word `2` and so on

## Steps
1. From the console, read in a sentence (with spaces)
2. Ask the user to enter a word number
3. Output the word at that number

## Test Cases
```
Test 1

Choose a word number: 1
Hello
