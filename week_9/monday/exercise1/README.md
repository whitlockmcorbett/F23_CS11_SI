# Instructions
**Objective:** Use functions and better programming practices to shorten the given code

## Background information
My best attempt at shortening this is 17 lines.
  
## Steps
Be sure to retain the following coding practices:
1. Lines must be less than or equal to 100 characters 
2. Variables must have descriptive names (you can change these names as long as yours are descriptive)
3. You may use integer literals and string literals
4. Do not put more than one statement on the same line. Aka no
    ```cpp
    percent1 = count1 / word1.size() * 100; percent2 = count2 / word2.size() * 100;
    ```
