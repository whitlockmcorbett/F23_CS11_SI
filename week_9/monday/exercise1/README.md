# Instructions
**Objective:** Use functions and better programming practices to shorten the given code

## Background information
My best attempt at shortening this is 17 lines (although the more reasonable solution has 21 lines)
  
## Steps
Be sure to retain the following coding practices:
1. Lines must be less than or equal to 100 characters 
2. Variables must have descriptive names (you can change these names as long as yours are descriptive)
3. You *may* use integer literals and string literals
4. Do not put more than one statement on the same line. Aka no
    ```cpp
    percent1 = count1 / word1.size() * 100; percent2 = count2 / word2.size() * 100;
    ```
5. Do not use arrays, just to make sure everyone is on the same playing field here
